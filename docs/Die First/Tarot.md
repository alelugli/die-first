# üÉè Die First ‚Äì The Arcana of Power

## üåå Tarot as Power Cards

I intend to use **Aleister Crowley‚Äôs Thoth Tarot** as **power cards** in the game. I appreciate the **cosmic representation** he gives to the Arcana, as it aligns with the **game‚Äôs thematic vision**.

The cards can be integrated into **chapters**, each representing a key **aspect of power, fate, and transformation**.
