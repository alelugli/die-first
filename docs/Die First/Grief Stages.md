# ðŸ–¤ The Five Stages of Grief in Psychological Horror

In *Die First*, grief is not a background themeâ€”it is **woven into the very fabric of the experience**. Each stage represents a layer of emotional descent and transformation, both for the player and the world around them.

| **Stage**      | **Description**  |
|----------------|------------------|
| **ðŸ•³ Denial**      | A state of **refusal and disbelief**, where the mind protects itself by **acting as if nothing has changed**. Denial is a **temporary defense** against overwhelming pain, creating a dissonance between perception and truth. |
| **ðŸ”¥ Anger**       | As reality sets in, **rage emerges**â€”sometimes irrational, often misdirected. The player may question, *"Why me?"*, directing fury inward, outward, or toward the world. In this stage, the world itself might **respond in kind**. |
| **ðŸ”— Bargaining**  | The mind seeks **control or reversal** through negotiationâ€”sometimes with unseen forces, sometimes with itself. Players might offer sacrifices or attempt impossible deals, trying to stave off the inevitable. |
| **ðŸ’§ Depression**   | The weight of the truth settles. Feelings of **emptiness, despair, and isolation** surface. The world feels colder. Movement becomes slower. Light grows dim. This stage reflects the emotional paralysis that grief brings. |
| **ðŸŒ™ Acceptance**   | Acceptance does not erase pain, but it allows space for **clarity and forward movement**. Here, the player begins to adaptâ€”not by forgetting, but by carrying the grief forward as **part of who they now are**. |

ðŸ©¸ *Grief in Die First is more than emotionalâ€”it shapes the labyrinth, alters perception, and challenges identity.*
