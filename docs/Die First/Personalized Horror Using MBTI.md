# üß† Personalized Horror Using MBTI & Player Fears

## 1. Adaptive Horror Through MBTI

The MBTI framework can be used to **personalize fear**, adapting the game‚Äôs horror elements to each player‚Äôs psychological profile. Through behavior analysis and response patterns, the game creates a **tailored nightmare**, rooted in the **player‚Äôs own mind**.

### 1.1. Fear Reactions by MBTI Dimension
Each MBTI type responds differently to fear. The game can alter **jumpscares, ambient tension, and threats** based on the player‚Äôs dominant traits.

| **MBTI Dimension**                  | **Fear Response**                                                  | **In-Game Adaptation**                                                                 |

## 2. Identifying Fears, Phobias & Discomforts
To elevate psychological horror, the game investigates **personal fears** that can be remembered, recalled, and twisted into the environment.

### 2.1. Fear Discovery Questions
Players answer questions that subtly extract their **deepest discomforts**:

- What scares you more: complete isolation or constant surveillance?  
- Trapped in a small room, or exposed in a vast, open space?  
- A morally broken human or an alien entity beyond comprehension?  
- Total silence, or unexplained sounds in the dark?  
- Failing and losing progress, or being completely lost?  
- Instant death or lingering pain?  
- Reliving your worst mistake or knowing something terrible is coming?  
- Losing your body, or losing your identity?

### 2.2. In-Game Implementation
- These answers dynamically influence **sound design, lighting, dialogue, and enemy behavior**.
- The game can **remember and weaponize** the player‚Äôs fears in unexpected ways.
- Horror becomes **deeply personal**‚Äîcrafted uniquely for each experience.
