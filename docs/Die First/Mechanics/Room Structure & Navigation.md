# üåÄ **Room Structure & Navigation in Die First**

### **1. The Multidimensional Labyrinth**

The game consists of **512 interconnected rooms**, structured within a **9D Enneacube (Hypercube)**.

- Each room has **9 doors**, leading to **neighboring rooms** across multiple dimensions.
- The player must navigate this shifting space, following a **specific path based on the digits of Pi**.
- The **starting room** is numbered **31**, originally "3.1", but the **comma was formed by the protagonist's blood upon falling**.
- The correct sequence follows **41 - 59 - 26 - 53 - 58 - 97 - 93 - 23 - 84...**, defining the only safe route through the hypercube.

### **2. Navigation & Environmental Perception**

- With **up to 9 exits per room**, the player can explore in **multiple directions**.
- The **correct number** on a door is **only visible if the player's sanity is at the required depth level**.
- **Wrong rooms** may contain **traps, enemies, or spatial loops**.
- **Euclidean logic does not apply**‚Äîcertain doors may lead to **distorted versions of previously visited rooms**.

### **3. Dynamic Room Elements**

- Some rooms **shift and transform** after multiple entries and exits.
- **Sanity loss alters the appearance of rooms** and affects **how doors behave**.
- **Creatures emerge in incorrect rooms**, increasing the danger of exploration.
- Some doors may **change position** when the player looks away or backtracks.
- **Temporal echoes** may occur, revealing **fragments of past conversations or spectral shadows**.

### **4. Time Loops & The Influence of Sanity**

- **Each death resets the player to the beginning** of the hypercube‚Äîbut certain **connections may shift**.
- If **sanity reaches 0**, the player is sent back to the start, triggering the **enemy mechanic**.
- **Ghouls manifest in rooms where the player has died before**, making those areas **increasingly lethal over time**.
