# 🧠 Sanity Mechanics & Reality Perception in Die First

**1. The Role of Sanity**
Sanity is not just a resource—it is the lens through which reality is perceived. As the player descends into the Hypercube, their ability to interpret the world correctly deteriorates.
The player starts with 12 Sanity Points (SP).
Sanity determines whether the player can see the correct numbers on doors.
The deeper the level within the Hypercube, the lower the sanity must be to perceive reality as it truly is.

**2. Sanity Gain & Loss**

🔹 Gaining Sanity (Stabilizing Reality)
Following the correct path (+1 SP per correct room).
Using certain light sources or rituals that stabilize perception.
Discovering specific safe rooms or relics that offer a temporary reprieve.

🔻 Losing Sanity (Falling Into the Abyss)

Entering wrong rooms (-1 SP per incorrect room).
Witnessing abnormalities, entities, or paradoxical architecture.
Remaining too long in an unstable area.
Facing hostile creatures (fear drains sanity).

⚠️ If Sanity reaches 0, the player experiences a full mental collapse, causing:

Immediate game reset (loop restarts).
A Ghoul manifests in that room, making it permanently more dangerous.
The Hypercube subtly alters, creating new distortions in the path forward.

**3. Psychological & Environmental Effects of Sanity Loss**

As sanity depletes, the game world becomes increasingly unstable:

🩸 At 9 SP → Subtle distortions in lighting and shadows.

👁 At 7 SP → Door numbers begin flickering or misaligning.

🔊 At 5 SP → Distant whispers, footsteps behind the player.

🕳 At 3 SP → Doors may lead to rooms that should not exist.

💀 At 1 SP → Creatures may appear where none should be.

🌀 At 0 SP → The world collapses, resetting into a new cycle with added threats.

**4. Strategic Considerations**

Players must balance sanity loss carefully—if they remain too stable, they won’t perceive the correct path.
Deliberate sanity reduction might be necessary, but pushing too far leads to irreversible consequences.
Some abilities, relics, or interactions may allow controlled sanity management, offering a risk-reward mechanic.

🕳️ The deeper you go, the more the world breaks. But what if you need to break yourself to see the truth?
