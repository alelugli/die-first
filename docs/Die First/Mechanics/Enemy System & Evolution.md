# 👁️ **Enemy System & Evolution in Die First**

## **1. Initial Enemy Distribution**

- **The first run is enemy-free**—allowing the player to explore the labyrinth **before encountering true danger**.
- The **first death always spawns a Ghoul**.
- The **number of enemies increases proportionally** to the **player's total deaths**.

<p></p>

## **2. Hostile Creatures**

At this stage, the game introduces **two primary enemy types**:

### **🧟 Ghouls – The Dead That Follow**

- **Undead beings** that are **intimidated by light** and **hunt using sound**.

### **👁️ Abominations – The Lightbound Horrors**

- **Blind creatures** that **ignore sound but relentlessly pursue sources of light**.

## **3. Ghouls – Death-Born Entities**

### **⚰️ How Ghouls Are Created**

- Each time the player **dies and resets the cycle**, a **Ghoul appears** in the room where the death occurred.
- **Ghouls that have previously killed the player level up**, becoming more dangerous.
- At **level 5, Ghouls evolve into Abominations**, gaining new behaviors.

### **🩸 Ghoul Behavior**

- **Patrol their assigned rooms**, attacking players who are **too far from a light source** or without **a light in hand**.
- If a **Ghoul sees the player**, it **pursues them into adjacent rooms**.
- **Follows sounds**—footsteps, breathing, interactions.
- The player can **use torches, lanterns, and in-game light sources** to **repel or manipulate them**.

## **4. Abominations – The Lightborn Stalkers**

### **👁️ Abomination Behavior**

- **Aggressively patrol their territory**.
- **Stronger than Ghouls** but **completely deaf**.
- **Drawn to any source of light**, making them **both predictable and dangerous**.
- **Can be evaded by manipulating light placement**.

🕳️ *Each death spawns a shadow. The more you fall, the less light remains.*
