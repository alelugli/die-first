# 🎮 The Future of Games – A Manifesto

## 🔥 **Why We Are Here**

We are **product designers, artists, and visionaries**, and we refuse to be trapped in the **monolith of repetition** that plagues game development. Our goal is to **craft polished, compelling experiences** using the skills we already excel at—**research, design, and storytelling**.

We are here to build **something meaningful**, not just another iteration of the same mechanics wrapped in a new skin. We want to break the **echo chamber of gaming**, where ideas loop endlessly between remakes, microtransactions, and nostalgia farming.

We want to make **games that transcend audiences**—where the avid novel reader, the hardcore strategist, and the casual mobile player all find **something that speaks to them**.

## 🚀 **What We Will Do**

We will **start small but purposeful**—games that are **simple yet captivating**, standing out through **experience-driven design**.

We don’t need endless budgets or bloated teams. The industry is full of examples:

- **Stardew Valley** brought cozy gaming to new heights, outshining lesser attempts like the **“tanuki's little village” clone factory**.
- **Undertale** has a codebase so cursed it could be a horror game itself—yet its narrative **made people cry in pixels**.
- **Disco Elysium** is an interactive novel that **should be gifted to non-gamers**, if only it didn’t require an entire console to play.
- **Civilization I** was built on a **486 processor** and still created a genre.

We will design games **that break expectations**—games that can be **played in multiple ways**. The kind that even the **Cheeto-stained basement nerd** has to pause and admit: *"Damn. This is something else."*

## 🤝 **Why You? Why Us?**

Because I **like** this team. I like your **perspectives, opinions, and the way we work together**. And I believe we can do more:

1️⃣ **Transition our expertise** from websites and apps to **games**, leveraging what we already do best.

2️⃣ **Create projects we’re proud of**—games that aren’t just marketable, but **meaningful**.

## 🔄 **How We Work**

### 🌎 A Structure That Reflects Our Values

We are not a **hierarchy**, nor a **corporate machine**. We are a **network**, inspired by the **Valve organizational model**—where roles are **fluid and adapt** to the project's needs.

🔧 **Craftsmanship Matters** – Each part of the process will be **refined and polished**, like the work of **a Japanese blacksmith with OCD**—obsessive precision, methodical execution.

🔍 **Quality Over Volume** – Not everyone here has been a gamer since birth. Some might not even identify as gamers at all. But that’s the point: **we need diverse perspectives to break the cycle**.

🏆 **Find the Best in Every Field** – If a skill is missing, we **seek out the right partners** rather than forcing a poor fit. **Excellence over convenience.**

## 🔧 **The Essential Roles for an MVP**

We have distilled the absolute **core roles necessary** for a polished **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**, based on real industry insights.

This structure isn’t static. As a **network**, roles **will evolve** based on needs, expertise, and goals. What matters is the **people, not the titles.**

---

## 🔮 **The Future We’re Building**

Every person has **a story**. And with the right approach, even someone obsessed with **lasers, dinosaurs, and metal** can be drawn into an introspective game about **a girl caring for her mother**.

It could be a **boy searching for his lost swim trunks in school**.
It could be **a musical game that actually generates a real musical**.

We are not here to tell **my** story.
We are here to tell **ours**.

🎭 **We are creating the next era of gaming.**
We will make **boomers, gym bros, and FIFA fans realize** that gaming is not just entertainment—it is an experience that no other medium can provide.

The time is now. Let’s make it happen. 🚀
