### *A Cosmic Horror Investigation Game*

## **1. Overview**

Genre: Horror, Psychological Horror, Survival, Investigative

Perspective: Isometric / Top-Down

Inspiration: *Silent Hill, Darkwood, Bloodborne, H.R. Giger, The Thing, Event Horizon, The Mist*

Platforms: PC (potential for console release)

### **Core Concept**

You are trapped in a single room that constantly shifts across different eras, fusing with temples of eldritch deities. Every time you die, you wake up in a different temporal version of the same place. The deeper you go, the more you realize: the creatures hunting you are your own past versions, twisted by time and madness.

Your goal? Find the truth before it finds you.

But you always die first.

## **2. Core Gameplay Pillars**

1️⃣ Looping Temporal Horror – Death resets the world, but never in the same way. Each cycle warps the environment, adding new threats.

2️⃣ Cosmic Horror & Sanity Mechanics – Reality itself is unstable. The more you uncover, the less you can trust what you see.

3️⃣ Investigative Narrative & Environmental Storytelling – No direct exposition. Clues are found through environmental details, cryptic texts, and the protagonist’s fragmented diary.

4️⃣ Survival & Strategic Combat – Limited resources, weak weapons, and encounters that demand either intelligence or sacrifice.

5️⃣ Time-Locked Labyrinth – Movement follows non-Euclidean logic, with doors leading to different eras instead of physical locations.

## **3. Gameplay Mechanics**

### A. Time Loop System & Room Shifting

- Every time the protagonist dies, they restart in the same room, but at a different point in time.
- Some rooms feel "normal" while others are fused with Deep One ruins, technorganic horrors, or fully alien dimensions.
- Progression is non-linear, requiring players to track which versions of the room are safest.
- Each loop introduces more threats—previous deaths spawn new creatures.

### B. Sanity & Perception Mechanics

- Sanity deteriorates with knowledge. The more the player uncovers, the more the world twists.
- Changes include:
    
    🔹 Texts and symbols distorting into alien languages.
    
    🔹 Creatures appearing only at specific sanity thresholds.
    
    🔹 Hallucinations leading the player astray.
    
- The protagonist’s diary (found in fragments) is the only source of stability.

### C. Combat & Survival Horror Elements

- Weapons are crude or ritualistic. No guns—only knives, tools, and glyphs that repel certain horrors.
- Fighting is risky. Creatures are stronger, and many can only be stalled, not killed.
- Some monsters react to sound or light, forcing stealth and strategy.
- Rituals can alter the environment, weakening certain enemies or revealing hidden paths.

### D. The Time-Locked Labyrinth (Pi-Based Room System)

- The room follows a mathematical logic inspired by Pi, causing unpredictable layouts.
- Doors labeled "Forward, Return, Alternate" allow movement through different temporal versions of the room.
- Some paths reset progress while others lead deeper into the temple.

### E. The Final Confrontation

- The final enemy is yourself—your original version, still performing the ritual.
- The player must fight or disrupt the ritual, choosing between:
    1. Breaking the cycle (potentially starting a worse one).
    2. Letting it continue (accepting their fate as an eldritch horror).

## 4. Narrative & Worldbuilding

### A. The Setting – A Room Across Eras

- The entire game takes place in one room, shifting through different epochs of its existence:
    1. An ordinary office – The protagonist's past life.
    2. A sacrificial temple – A cult’s ancient domain.
    3. A Deep One abyss – Partially sunken and overtaken by aquatic horrors.
    4. A biomechanical nightmare – Walls made of flesh-metal hybrids, twisting with unseen logic.
    5. A fully alien realm – A non-Euclidean void, beyond human comprehension.

### B. The Protagonist’s Story

- A scholar who discovered pieces of the Necronomicon, leading to obsession and madness.
- They performed a ritual, seeking to escape the cosmic horror that will consume humanity.
- As punishment, the Elders granted them eternal death—dying first, forever.
- The player uncovers this story in reverse, as texts and echoes reveal their own past mistakes.

### C. The Diary & The Rosetta System

- Pages of the protagonist’s diary are scattered through the cycles.
- Some are illegible until the player finds the Rosetta artifact.
- Once fully translated, the diary reveals:
    
    🔹 The protagonist caused their own imprisonment.
    
    🔹 The monsters are all their past selves.
    
    🔹 There is no true escape—only different choices.

## 5. Art & Audio Direction

### A. Visual Style

- Inspired by H.R. Giger, Darkwood, and Bloodborne.
- Textures shift subtly over time, reflecting reality’s corruption.
- Creatures have human remnants (watches, rings, clothes) hinting at their past identities.
- Lighting changes with sanity, creating eerie red glows, shifting shadows, and unseen movements.

### B. Sound & Atmosphere

- No traditional soundtrack—only deep hums, whispers, and cosmic drone.
- Sound cues indicate things that may not actually be there.
- The protagonist’s breathing changes based on their sanity.

### C. Interface & UI Design

- Minimal HUD, with information shown via:
    
    🔹 Handwritten notes overlaying the screen.
    
    🔹 Flickering UI when sanity drops.
    
    🔹 Clocks and patterns in the environment hinting at time mechanics.

## 7. Summary Statement

"Die First" is a psychological cosmic horror game where death is only the beginning. Trapped in a single, ever-changing room, the player must navigate fractured realities, piece together their own past, and confront the terrifying truth: the monsters they face are all versions of themselves, lost to time. With each cycle, the horror deepens. There is no escape—only the illusion of choice."

## 🔹 What Works Best in *Die First*

### 1️⃣ The Core Horror Premise is Uniquely Disturbing

The idea of dying first, always, eternally is an oppressive concept that plays directly into cosmic horror’s core theme: the absence of escape, the futility of resistance, and the inevitability of fate.

✅ *Strength:* This makes the game feel existentially terrifying rather than just “scary.”

🔥 *Enhancement:* Make the *player* question if they were meant to break the loop or if that was always part of the loop. A false sense of agency can be powerful.

### 2️⃣ The Monsters are YOU

Having every enemy be a past version of the protagonist is pure psychological horror. It blurs the line between victim and villain, making every encounter a personal battle.

✅ *Strength:* This means combat isn't just survival—it’s self-destruction.

🔥 *Enhancement:* The game could change difficulty dynamically—the more the player fights, the smarter and stronger the enemies get (because they learn from their own past combat strategies). A cycle of self-sabotage.

### 3️⃣ The Environment as a Living Entity

The single mutating room avoids the need for large maps while delivering constant variety. The Pi-based movement system (non-linear spatial shifts) makes the room feel sentient, unpredictable, and impossible to map conventionally.

✅ *Strength:* Makes backtracking impossible to master, keeping paranoia high.

🔥 *Enhancement:* Allow the room to shift slightly even while being observed (objects moving when you look away, doors subtly changing before you pass through them).

### 4️⃣ Sanity as a Core Gameplay Mechanic

Instead of just being a UI stat, sanity actually changes the environment dynamically.

✅ *Strength:* Encourages *deliberate madness*—the player must lose their mind to progress, but doing so makes the world more hostile.

🔥 *Enhancement:* Add sanity-based puzzles—some doors only exist when the player is sufficiently insane.

## 🩸 What Can Be Improved or Expanded?

### 1️⃣ Combat Should Reinforce Powerlessness, Not Power

Right now, combat sounds strategic (symbol traps, improvisational weapons), which is good. But fighting should feel desperate, never empowering.

🛠️ *Fix:* Instead of traditional combat, weapons should have a cost—using them accelerates the loop, worsening the player's condition (ex: killing enemies means you’re reborn more deteriorated).

🛠️ *Alternative:* Some weapons may cause the player to “glitch” into another time, skipping ahead but missing key information.

### 2️⃣ The Loop’s Rules Need to Be Semi-Predictable

Right now, the loop is completely unstable, which makes every cycle unpredictable. This is terrifying but could also cause frustration if players feel aimless.

🛠️ *Fix:* Establish some soft rules—maybe each death changes only one major factor (ex: environment mutates, but past knowledge remains intact).

🛠️ *Alternative:* Introduce Loop Anchors—objects that remain consistent across cycles, allowing players to track some form of progress.

### 3️⃣ The "Memento" Reverse Storytelling Needs a Strong Emotional Payoff

Right now, the story is discovered in fragments, but the player needs a strong emotional hit at the end—cosmic horror usually risks feeling detached.

🛠️ *Fix:* The final diary page should be a plea for help from their past self, a desperate message that contradicts everything the player believed.

🛠️ *Alternative:* The player’s own voice could play distorted messages in reverse—statements that only make sense once the full loop is understood.

### 4️⃣ The Final Choice Needs to Feel Like It Matters (Even If It Doesn't)

The best cosmic horror games make the player feel like their choices were significant… even if they never were.

🛠️ *Fix:* After the final confrontation, no matter what the player chooses, they wake up in the room again—but something is off. The loop is not identical this time. Something has changed, but they don’t know what.

🛠️ *Alternative:* Allow the player to exit the loop—but at the cost of someone else being trapped instead (a faceless figure taking their place). The horror continues, just… not for them.

---

## 🔻 Final Enhancements for Maximum Impact

### 🔺 Adding an "Unknowable" Element

Cosmic horror is strongest when not everything is explained. Right now, the game reveals the full truth if the player finds all diary pages.

🛠️ *Fix:* Some parts should remain permanently unsolved. Certain symbols should never be translated, and certain whispers should never be understandable.

### 🔺 Breaking the Fourth Wall Subtly

🛠️ *Fix:* The game should acknowledge the player's existence—maybe text messages in the game use their real username, or whispers directly say their name (pulled from system data).

🛠️ *Alternative:* The game "remembers" how the player plays, subtly calling out behaviors ("You always run when scared, don’t you?").

### 🔺 Visual Instability & UI Breakdown

As sanity deteriorates, the game itself should feel unstable:

- Menus shift subtly—options disappear or rearrange themselves.
- The HUD starts flickering, showing hints of what’s ahead.
- Dialogue rewrites itself mid-sentence, contradicting past events.

---

## 🔮 The Big Picture Takeaway

### *"Die First" should feel like a game that knows more about the player than the player knows about it.*

The core concept is incredible—it just needs a few refinements to ensure:

✔ The loop doesn’t feel *random*—it needs *some* structure.

✔ Combat remains desperate, not empowering.

✔ The final revelation hits emotionally—not just intellectually.

✔ Some mysteries remain unsolvable, keeping the horror intact.
