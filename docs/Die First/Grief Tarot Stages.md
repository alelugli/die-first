# ü•Ä Stages of Grief ‚Äì Psychological & Symbolic Framework

## **1. Emotional Stages of Grief**
Each stage reflects a natural process of **human coping** in the face of loss, trauma, or transformation. These states may not follow a linear order and can overlap, recur, or intensify depending on the individual and context.

| **Stage**     | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Denial**    | A defense mechanism that softens the immediate impact of loss. The person acts as if nothing has changed, struggling to accept reality. Denial provides temporary psychological shelter from intense emotional pain. |
| **Anger**     | As reality sinks in, feelings of **injustice and rage** emerge. The person may ask *"Why me?"*, directing frustration toward themselves, others, or fate itself. |
| **Bargaining**| In this phase, the person tries to **negotiate with the universe**, offering promises or changes in behavior in hopes of reversing or easing the loss. |
| **Depression**| When the truth feels undeniable, it can give way to **deep sorrow, isolation, and emotional exhaustion**. A sense of meaninglessness may overshadow daily life. |
| **Acceptance**| This final stage is not about forgetting, but about **integration and moving forward**. The person begins to accept the reality of the loss and searches for ways to rebuild, while still carrying the memory. |
