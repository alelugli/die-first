ğŸ”¥ Die First â€“ The Nightmare That Remembers You ğŸ”¥
Trapped in a shifting labyrinth beyond time, you are not just hunted by horrorsâ€”you are one of them. Each death distorts reality, reshaping the world in ways you cannot predict. The more you fall, the more the nightmare remembers.

ğŸ’€ Sanity is your only guide, but it is fleeting. Lose too much, and the walls between reality and delusion collapse.

ğŸŒ€ Your past selves have left tracesâ€”were they warnings or just echoes of a doomed cycle?

There is a way forward. There must be.
But every step brings a new question: Are you escaping the labyrinth, or are you the one creating it?
